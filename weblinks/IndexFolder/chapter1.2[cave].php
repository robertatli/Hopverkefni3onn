			They tell you that you have to go east to find the cave, you thank them and head your way on the road heading east.<br><br> After some time you come to a crossroad. The road to the left seems to lead to a lake. You think that there must be someone to ask directions there. The road to the right leads to a large hill. You think that the cave might be in the hill.<br><br> Will you go to the lake or the large hill?<br><br><br>
